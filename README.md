# Lidar
This is a lab project for Operating Systems COP5614
The goal of this lab is to introduce the GatorEye LiDAR database provided by National Forests in Florida (NFF) at the USDA Forest Service. This lab will guide students to open LiDAR image and convert it into DEM (Digital Elevation Model), DSM (Digital Surface Map), and DTM (digital terrain model) for Terrain and hydrological analysis. The lab will then demonstrate different noise removal algorithms (Gaussian and Median) and also performs segmentation and slicing to fill the depression sinks on DEM using level set algorithm.
The lab description can be find under lidar.doc and lidar.pdf
